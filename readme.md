### SynClip

A **Multi-Platform Clipboard** tool designed to synchronize "Copy-Paste" functionality across multiple devices seamlessly. It works in two modes:  

1. **LAN-Based Synchronization**: Connects devices on the same local network (LAN) to instantly share clipboard content without requiring an internet connection.  
2. **Account-Based Synchronization**: Utilizes a real-time database to synchronize clipboard content across devices connected through the same user account, making it accessible even over the internet.  

This tool ensures cross-platform compatibility, enabling efficient clipboard sharing between different operating systems and devices.
